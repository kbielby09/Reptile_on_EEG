# Reptile_on_EEG
Final project for EE402 (machine learning on biomedical signals) at Clarkson University. This repository contains an application of few-shot learning on EEG (electroencephalography) data taken from an open source dataset. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the application of OpenAI's Reptile on few shot classification of EEG signals.
